# 30_Days_Of_Code

## 30 Days of Code started on Novemer 13th 2018.
Will be solving one problem each on HackerRank and LeetCode

#### Day 0 
>1. A single line of text denoting (the variable whose contents must be printed).

>2. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
#### Day 1
>1. Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
    Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables. 
    Use the  operator to perform the following operations: 
    Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
    Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
    
>2. Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

>3. Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
### Day 2
>1. Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.
>Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

>2. Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
### Day 3
>1. Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
>2. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
